Exercise 7 - Table Creation (DDL)
_________________________________

1.create table DEPT(
                    id  number(7) primary key,
                    name varchar2(25)
                  );
describe DEPT

2.insert into DEPT select department_id,department_name from departments

3.create table EMP(
                    id          number(7),
                    first_name  varchar2(25),
                    last_name   varchar2(25),
                    dept_id     number(7), 
                    constraint E_D_FK foreign key(dept_id)
                    references DEPT(id)
                  );

4.create table employees2 as
select employee_id as id,first_name,last_name,salary,department_id as dept_id 
from employees


5.alter table employees2 read only


6.insert into employees2
  values(34, 'Grant', 'Marcie', 5678,10)
  The execution of this query gives error


7.alter table employees2 read write
  insert into employees2(
  values(34, 'Grant',' Marcie', 5678,10)

8.drop table employees2

Part 1


1.create view employees_vu
as select employee_id,last_name as EMPLOYEES,department_id from employees;


2.describe employees_vu


select * from employees_vu



3.select department_id,EMPLOYEES from employees_vu

4.create view dept_50 
  as select employee_id as emp_no,last_name as EMPLOYEES,department_id as dept_no from employees 
  where department_id=50
  with read only;

5.describe dept_50
  select * from dept_50

6.update dept_50 set dept_no=80 where EMPLOYEES='matos'   --->Throws an error as the view is read only


7.create sequence dept_id_seq2
  start with 500
  increment by 10
  maxvalue 1000
  nocache
  nocycle;
  
8.insert into DEPT(ID,NAME) values(dept_id_seq2.nextval,'Education');
  insert into DEPT(ID,NAME) values(dept_id_seq2.nextval,'Administration');

9.create index dept_index on DEPT(NAME);


10. create synonym EMP1 for employees
